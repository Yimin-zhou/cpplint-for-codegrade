# cpplint for codegrade
 
In the current 1st-year beginner c++ programming class, the c++ code assignments are partially tested by CodeGrade and the code style is manually checked by TAs. Code style checking can be hard and inconsistent among TAs sometimes, so developing some automatical code quality checking tools that can be integrated with CodeGrade and output consistent feedback is very necessary.
